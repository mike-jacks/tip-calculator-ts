# Typescript Tip Calculator

Typescript Tip Calculator using React and typescript assignment.

In this assignment, I practiced using Typescript, React, and CSS modules.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:mike-jacks/tip-calculator-ts.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the downloaded repository folder

   ```bash
   cd tip-calculator-ts
   ```

3. Run npm install

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Run in dev mode

1. Run 'npm run dev' command to run in dev mode

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Build and Run in preview mode

1. Run 'npm run build'

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Run 'npm run preview'

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

You should now have the app running in either dev mode or preview mode locally.
